# [Generative Poster Group project]

![Example final poster](ExampleImage.png)

**Created by:** Adamya, Dafu, Cream, and Emily  
**Course:** Creative Coding, Pratt Institute  
**Semester:** Fall 2026

## About the Project

[Write a short description of your project. What was the idea behind your poster generator? What visual qualities or design ideas inspired it? How does the program combine everyone's individual tile designs into a unified composition?]

## The Interface

The user can input their title for the poster, the scale of the poster through tiles, and the color palette they want for their poster.

After collecting this information, it puts those values into the function that runs the poster generation.

To generate the poster it runs through a loop that places the tiles next to each other according to the user input. 

## Meet the Designers

- **Cream:** Worked on the canvas configuration and the conditional logic that differentiates corners, borders, and internal cells.
- **Emily:** Worked on organizing the project into Github as separate modules, tiles rotation, and tiles sizing.
- **Adamya:** [Brief description of their tile designs or contribution.]
- **Dafu:** [Brief description of their tile designs or contribution.]

## Try it yourself

### How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the setup cells to download the project code and install the required libraries.
3. Run the cell that calls the function and prompts the user to choose a title, grid dimensions, and color palette.
4. Your own poster will be saved as poster.svg!
